# EEC-Developers

We are a small group of Amiga enthusiasts who wish to continue development on the AmigaE compiler by Wouter van Oortmersen.  Come join us in submitting pull requests and helping solve issues.  Our code is based on ECX, the E Compiler eXtended but to avoid confusion, we changed the name to Enhanced E Compiler, abbreviated EEC.
